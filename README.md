# Cyclone-Trajectory-Prediction
Repository for predicting the trajectory of cyclones given its previous path locations int he form of lattitude and longitude with the help of LSTM's

Finally after prediction I have used Google Map API to plot the predicted locations to convey the tranjectory in a visual manner.
